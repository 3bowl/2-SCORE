**2-SCORE**   --   A Python Bowling Scorer

#

***How to use:***

* The input prompt lets you fill in shots within each frame (only one shot at a time)

* Input 'X' for a strike (only works when it makes sense; you'll be reprompted if it doesn't make sense) **Note: typing '10' won't work**

* Input '/' for a spare (only works when it makes sense; you'll be reprompted if it doesn't make sense) **Note: typing the number that would make the previous shot + the current shot = 10 won't work**

* Input 0-9 for numbers

***Features:***

* Reprompts the user if the input doesn't make sense

* Activating EOFError will exit the program
